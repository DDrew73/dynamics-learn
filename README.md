# dynamics-learn
Working directory for my final project in EECS289a: Intro to Machine Learning and EE291e: Hybrid Systems and Intelligent Control.

------------

# Project Goal

# To Do:
- set up dynamics exploration system around an equilibrium point to colelct training data
- visualization program of dynamics exploration
- methods to create dynamics estimators
  - neural networks
  - least squares
  - gaussian processes
  - advanced?
- dynamics model for quadrotor
- dynamcis model for any other robot to consider
- writing up all above
- control structure
  - mpc
  - iLQR
  - many choices
